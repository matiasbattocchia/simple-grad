# SimpleGrad

This work is a self-contained implementation of reverse mode automatic differentiation,
based on that of PyTorch's and made way more simpler with the intention to understand the basics
of how it works.

This is a Rust implementation of the code I found in
[A Gentle Introduction to `torch.autograd`](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html)
tutorial, below further readings, a notebook named
[Example implementation of reverse-mode autodiff](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VpeE6UvEPRz9HmsHh1KS0XxXjYu533EC).
